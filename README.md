A fast paced space shooter game.
This game is comparable to FTL crossed with a fast paced scrolling shooter implementing RPG elements.

Development

Quick Play (Similar to an arena mode) is scheduled to come out a week after the new year (or sooner).
This would be a goal for a working beta version (not final).
Campaign will be started once the game engine is perfected.
Multiplayer is expected to release after the game's sucsess has been evaluated after launch.

To be announced. Read log.


Log
========
9/9/13: Quick update: Our quickplay is just you flying around with nobody to shoot. Lasers are implmented with tracking,
and more weapon framework is being added. Framework for systems and damage registration is slowed by constant bugs and
schoolwork. The next few weeks will see some awesome improvement! Wait for systems, enemies, GUI, more sounds, more weapons,
and better maps to fly around in.
9/9/13: README Created.
9/6/13: The project has been started on GitHub. 


Installation
========
No instructions. This game is currently under closed-source, and no open version to the public is released.
An open version will most likely be released after the quick play goal is met.
